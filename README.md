# OpenBot Discord Bot

This discord bot is meant to serve as a starting project using TypeScript and Discord.js to allow for type safety for API Calls (Google Gemini, WeatherAPI, etc.). Using this Discord Application dynamically handles events and commands via file import. 

Any commands in the commands directory will dynamically import based on directory (same goes for event handlers). 
## Technology Used

- Google Gemini API
- Discord.js
- Open Weather API
- File Imports
- Event Handlers
- TypeScript
